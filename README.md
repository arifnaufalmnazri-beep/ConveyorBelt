# ConveyorBelt
It's as simple as it sounds. Conveyor belt built with Lego that runs on a stepper motor

## What it is exactly
Originally, I'd been searching for a project to pursue that'd help enhance my skills in electronics and mechanics. After a few days of thinking, the idea of a conveyor
belt came. This time, I also challenged myself to design the build first on paper. The design iterations which I'll show now. 

## The designs
I had two iterations of the design for the conveyor belt, the second of which came to me as I was illustrating the first, and was the design I implemented in the final 
product. 

Design 1:

## Materials
Much of the same materials from the previous builds were used here:

-Lego technic parts

-Tape

-Stepper motor

-Arduino UNO

-Tack

## How it works
Here's a gif of it moving:

The stepper motor connected to the arduino rotates anticlockwise, which spins the axle which the wheel is attached too. Then, the tape that serves as a conveyor belt gets pulled from that rotation. This forms a coherent conveyor belt that functions to bring items from one place to another, much like the gear shown in the video. With a few atlerations from the final design, such as the gears attached to the wheels and some extra lego pieces used behind to support the stepper motor, the final product turned out well in my opinion.
