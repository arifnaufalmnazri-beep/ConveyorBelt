# ConveyorBelt
It's as simple as it sounds. Conveyor belt built with Lego that runs on a stepper motor

## What it is exactly
Originally, I'd been searching for a project to pursue that'd help enhance my skills in electronics and mechanics. After a few days of thinking, the idea of a conveyor
belt came. This time, I also challenged myself to design the build first on paper. The design iterations which I'll show now. 

## The designs
I had two iterations of the design for the conveyor belt, the second of which came to me as I was illustrating the first, and was the design I implemented in the final 
product.

## Materials
Much of the same materials from the previous builds were used here:

-Lego technic parts

-Tape

-Stepper motor

-Arduino UNO

-Tack

## How it works
Here's a gif of it moving:
